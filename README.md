# FCL Data Structures

Python implementations and tests of data structures critical for the Free Case Law (FCL) system - a national legal archive managing 70,000+ judgments scaling to millions.

## Why Data Structures Matter for FCL

FCL faces unique challenges that make proper data structure selection critical:

### 1. **Hierarchical Legal Documents**
- LegalDocML's nested XML structure (judgment → sections → paragraphs → citations)
- Requires efficient tree traversal algorithms
- Must extract metadata without loading 500-page documents into memory

### 2. **Graph Networks of Citations**
- Judgments form directed graphs through citations
- Finding "most influential" cases requires handling cycles
- Must traverse chains 10+ levels deep without stack overflow

### 3. **Search Index Optimization**
- Instant search across millions of words requires:
  - Inverted indices for full-text search
  - Tries for autocomplete
  - B-trees for date ranges
  - Hash tables for O(1) metadata lookups

### 4. **Memory-Efficient Processing**
- Streaming XML parsers for large documents
- Memory-mapped files to avoid server crashes
- Django querysets with `select_related()` and `prefetch_related()` to prevent N+1 queries

### 5. **Complex Query Requirements**
- Boolean searches with proximity operators
- Position-aware data structures
- Bitmap indices for faceted search
- Must intersect millions of documents in milliseconds

## Performance Impact

Without proper data structures:
- Search would take minutes, not milliseconds
- Citation networks would cause stack overflow
- Memory usage would crash servers at scale
- Editorial interfaces would freeze on large documents

**The difference between O(n²) and O(log n) algorithms determines whether FCL remains usable at millions of judgments or becomes impossibly slow.**
